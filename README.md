## H-AirUp Mobile Application
In this project, the Machine Learning (ML) team's primary role is to develop a predictive model for weather and air quality index (AQI), leveraging our comprehensive dataset. This model forms the basis for generating informed predictions tailored to user inputs. These inputs are managed and transmitted by the Cloud Computing (CC) team, facilitating a seamless integration of predictive analytics into the user experience. This collaborative effort between ML and CC teams ensures that the model's insights are effectively utilized and aligned with user-specific needs.
